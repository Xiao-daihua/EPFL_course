  abstract = {These notes were presented at the Young Researchers School (YRS) in Maynooth in April 2024 and provide an introduction to Conformal Field Theory CFT, Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Defect Conformal Field Theory (DCFT). This class is mostly self-contained and includes exercises with solutions. The first part of these notes is concerned with the basics of CFT, and was taught by the author during the pre-school for the YRS 2024. Here the aim is to convey the notion of conformal families, their fusion and the construction of partition functions. The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraint are derived. Verlinde lines are constructed as their simplest solution and their properties are inspected.},

We solve this equation for the superconformal minimal models SM(p/p + 2) with p odd, and thereby provide a classification of the possible superconformal boundary conditions . In addition to the Neveu-Schwarz (N S) and Ramond (R) boundary states, there are N\texttildelow S states. The N S and N\texttildelow S boundary states are related by a Z2 ``spin-reversal'' transformation. We treat the tricritical Ising model as an example, and in an appendix we discuss the (non-superconformal) case of the Ising model.},

We argue that, using the argument of [JHEP 09 (2020) 018], this \$\textbackslash sqrt\textbraceleft 2\textbraceright\$ indicates a single unpaired Majorana zero mode, and that these two groups of boundary conditions are mutually incompatible.

Their fusion is non-singular and, using parallel transport on CFT deformation space, it can be reduced to fusion of defect lines in a single torus model. We show that the latter is described by a semi-group extension of O(d,d;Q), and that (on the level of Ramond charges) fusion of interfaces agrees with composition of associated geometric integral transformations. This generalizes the well-known fact that T-duality can be geometrically represented by Fourier-Mukai transformations. Interestingly, we find that the topological interfaces between torus models form the same semi-group upon fusion. We argue that this semi-group of orbifold equivalences can be regarded as the \textbackslash alpha' deformation of the continuous O(d,d) symmetry of classical supergravity.},
